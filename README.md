# ble_hw_flutter

Flutter app POC to interact with BLE peripheral.  App just has an on and off button and updates BLE characteristic value to 0 or 1.  It doesn't appear that there ia a good Flutter BLE library, We need to write those components in native code.  Android native code is TODO. 

The peripheral used is the LED example from the ArduinoBLE library.
